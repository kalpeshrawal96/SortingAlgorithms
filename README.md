# SortingAlgorithms
In this project many sorting algorithms are implemented in C with focus on cost. Cost is calculated by number of comparisons and number of moves done. Here weightage of comparison is 1 and move is 3. Cost of every algorithm with respect to data set is written on output.txt file.
Following are algorithms implemented
# Bubble Sort
* Left to Right
* Right to Left
* Left to Right for early exit
* Right to Left for early exit
* Shaker Sort
# Insertion Sort
* Left to Right
* Right to Left
* Shell Sort
# Selection Sort
* Left to Right
* Right to Left
# Heap Sort
# Quick Sort
